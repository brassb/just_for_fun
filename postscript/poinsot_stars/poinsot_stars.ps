%% This brings me back to the days of math class when I was in middle
%% school.  The math teacher showed us how to draw Poinsot Stars
%% (pronounced "PWON-soh").  Most of the stars we drew in class had
%% at most 15 or 20 points, and it was difficult to get that many
%% equally-spaced points located along the circumference of a circle,
%% using only a compass, straight edge, and perhaps a protractor for
%% those angles which were difficult or impossible to construct.  It
%% was time-consuming and error-prone, but the results were beautiful.
%%
%% Poinsot Stars are trivially easy to draw using Adobe Postscript and
%% a viewer program which can display the results, convert to PDF, and
%% print to hardcopy if desired.  Much better than doing it by hand!
%%
%% My 5-year-old son Andy loves to play with this program, tweaking
%% the values of the numpoints and increment variables to see what
%% type of beautiful pattern will be drawn onto the computer screen.
%%
%% A few sample star configurations are provided in this file; just
%% uncomment one (and only one) star configuration and open this file
%% in a modern Postscript/PDF viewer utility to see what it looks like.
%%
%% NOTE: The values of the numpoints and increment variables must be
%% relatively prime to each other (they must have no common factors).
%% Failure to observe this will result in a star with fewer points
%% than expected.
